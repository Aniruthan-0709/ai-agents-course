      "  - Stability and culture: A steady coaching setup (e.g., Stephen Fleming) and a core group of players foster continuity and teamwork.\n",
      "  - Talent development: The franchise has a track record of nurturing and integrating talented players, often turning them into IPL stars.\n",
      "  - Home advantage and support: Chennai’s Chepauk stadium provides a supportive home crowd and spin-friendly conditions that CSK often adapt to well.\n",
